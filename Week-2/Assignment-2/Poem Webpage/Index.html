            I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
            Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />Then there's a pair of us!<br />
            Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br />
            How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br />How public - like a Frog -<br />
            To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!<br />
        </p>
