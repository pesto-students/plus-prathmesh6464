#### What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

# Scalling :

Scalling is process of increasing or decreasing numbers of servers or servers properties like RAM, CPU, Memory etc.

### Importantce of Web Application :

- Scalling is cost efficient
- protect from web sever down, according to our need we can increase or decrease size of web server
- according to traffic it will increase number of servers or descrease number of servers.

### Types of Scalling :

there are two type of scalling first is verticale scalling and horizontal scaling

1. Verticle Scalling (Scalling Up):

   - Verticale scalling means if user's website traffic increase then we can replpace RAM, Memory, CPU to higher size, this way we are increasing the processing power of server by increasing server properites like CPU, RAM and Memory this is called vertical scalling or scalling up.
   - if user's website traffic decrease then we can replpace RAM, Memory, CPU to back to previous size.
   - while replacing RAM, Memory, CPU size to higher size, website can be down for this process.

2. Horizontal Scalling (Scalling Out):

   - Horizontal Scalling means if user's website traffice increase then adding new server to it. server count be depend up on traffic size, this way we are increasing power of server by adding new number servers according to our traffic size of server this process is called horizontal scalling or scalling out.
   - if user's website traffic decrease then we can remove newly added server according to decreased traffic
   - if server got error and could not able to run, then we can add new server and using old server's information we can create new server, in this case down time of horizontal server is less.
